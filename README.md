# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor



## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

These were the main design flaws I fixed in the original starter code:
